## 🔍 Project Description

The Obstacle Avoider Robot is a smart robotic system that uses sensors to detect obstacles in its path and takes evasive action to avoid collisions. It is built around the 8051 microcontroller, making it an ideal project for embedded systems and robotics enthusiasts.

The robot continuously monitors its surroundings, and based on sensor inputs, alters its movement to navigate safely in dynamic environments.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Sensors continuously scan for obstacles ahead  
2. When an obstacle is detected within a threshold distance, the microcontroller triggers appropriate motor actions to avoid collision  
3. Robot changes direction and resumes forward motion  
4. The process repeats for smooth, autonomous navigation
